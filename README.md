# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to detect handwritten digits using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of labeled images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to accurately classify these digits based on the input images.
